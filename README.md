# Domain-Adversarial-Training-of-Neural-Networks

This is the implementation of the paper Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07818.pdf
Two modes - Source only mode and Domain Adverserial Neural Network Mode are implemented.
Source Domain is MNIST while target domain is MNIST-M
